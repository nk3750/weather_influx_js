# Historical Weather App


To install:

-Clone the repository to your local machine

-Once the repository is cloned locally, go ahead and access the /weather_app_tutorial directory from the terminal and run npm install to install the backend dependencies from the package.json file.

-While still inside /weather_app_tutorial navigate into the /client directory and then do the same thing by running npm install to install all of the dependencies that are required for React.

-In the root directory navigate to /server/ and run node server.js to start up the Express server..

-If you head over to http://localhost:5000/ in your web browser, you should see ‘PORT 5000’. This confirms the server is up and running.

-From the terminal, navigate into the /client directory and then run npm start. This will start up the React server on port 3000. (Check out: http://localhost:3000/ if the React scripts did not launch the application automatically.)



#### This application was created with Node.js, Express, React and the Influx DB. It supports two cities Atlanta and Rochester as of now.
